# If you don't like saying 'RAKE_ENV=production' on your command line or
# crontab, you can change it to anything you like here.  This is helpful
# if you have more than one of these applications co-existing on the same
# machine. (Although when we have done that, especially on linux, we like
# to create a operating-system user for each application.  That way the
# crontabs stay isolated.
